### Hi there, I'm Andy. Welcome to my Github.

I'm a developer and student in San Jose. My skills include: 
- Algorithms with C++ and Python
- Game development and FRC programming with Java
- Web development with HTML/CSS/JS.

I'm a coordinator at ![ThetaHacks](https://thetahacks.tech) and a member of the programming department at ![FRC Team #1351](https://www.amhsrobotics.com/). I'm also trying to make USACO Gold (with little success) :/
